Task 0.1
Convert this pseudocode into actual code. Make it run. Make sure you understand the results. This is a fundamental lesson:

x = 0
y = 1
Print the value of x
Print the value of y
x = x + 3
y = y + x
Print the value of x
Print the value of y

Task 0.2
Convert this pseudocode into actual code. Make it run. Make sure you understand the results. This is a fundamental lesson. If you don’t understand the results then spend some time Googling BODMAS.

x = 1 + 1 * 2
y = (1 + 1) * 2
z = 1 + ( 1 * 2 )
a = 1 + 1 * 2 / 2
b = (1 + 1 * 2 ) /  2

print all the things

Task 0.3
Write a function named hello, it needs to take in a string as an argument. The function should work like this:

eg: hello("Tshepo") should output

Hello Tshepo!

Task 0.4
Write a function named even_or_odd or evenOrOdd. Tha name of the function depends on the conventions of the language you are writing in. If you don’t know what name to choose then check the clean code guidelines.

Your function should take an integer and print in the work “even” or “odd”

eg, if the input is 3 then the output is “odd”. If the input is 4 then the output is “even”

Task 0.5
Write a function that takes in three numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.
